This project is maintained by [stlankes](https://github.com/stlankes/), who is member of the [Institute for Automation of Complex Power Systems](http://www.acs.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de/) at the [RWTH Aachen University](http://www.rwth-aachen.de/).
The first version of HermitCore was created by [stlankes](https://github.com/stlankes/), with lots of contributions from [spickartz](https://github.com/spickartz), [jbreitbart](https://github.com/jbreitbart) and other members of the RWTH Aachen University.

A first [paper](https://dl.acm.org/authorize?N04880), which sketchs the design of HermitCore, was prensted at the [International Workshop on Runtime and Operating Systems for Supercomputers (ROSS 2016)](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/events/workshops/ross/2016/program.php). The [slides](ross2016.pdf) summarize the design and present first performance results.
